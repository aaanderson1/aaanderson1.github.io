CSS needed
 1. Portfolio in the header should be 'Projects' 
 2. Does the Message Me section work? The contact information should be at the bottom of the home page 
 3. The majority of your information should exist on the home page, employers will likely not take the time to try and click around your site to find relevant info, you should make it as easy as possible 
 4. Your most impressive projects should be first, and should not be a long scrollable list, a grid is better 
 5. The site should read very similarly to your resume, content is broken up into relevant sections like Summary, Skills, Projects etc...
